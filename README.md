# Spring-25-How-Research-Works

This workshop is taught by Dan Woulfin (Computational Research Instruction Librarian, Columbia University) and Sydni Meyer (Teaching and Undergraduate Services Librarian, Columbia University). 
Emails: dw3105@columbia.edu and sm3871@columbia.edu (respectively)

Have you ever wondered how library databases produce results, or why one result seems more relevant than another? Join Dan Woulfin, the Computational Research Instruction Librarian, and Sydni Meyer, the Teaching and Undergraduate Services Librarian, from Columbia University Libraries to go "under the hood" of database search through discussion and code. Participants will leave this workshop as better researchers with a new understanding of how search works.

Some prior coding knowledge for this workshop would be helpful â€“ but all code will be explained step by step, making it accessible for those with little to no coding familiarity while still being engaging for more experienced programmers.
